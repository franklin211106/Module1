# DATA TYPES READ AND PRINT A STRING IN PYTHON

## AIM:
To write a python program to read a string from the user and thn print it 

## ALGORITHM:

1)Start with a list of numbers.

2)Assume the first number in the list is the largest you've found so far.

3)Go through the rest of the numbers in the list, one by one.

4)For each number, compare it to the "largest found so far."

5)If the current number is greater than the "largest found so far," then update "largest found so far" to this new number.

6)After checking all numbers, the "largest found so far" is the largest number in the list.

7)End.
